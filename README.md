For my design I will be using an array list to store the values of the csv reader files. 
I will then create a graph, edge and vertex class which will help my dijkstra algorithm decipher the shortest possible route. 
From then I will ask the user for input for starting city and attractions and ending city where I will get the item at a certain index of my arraylist to put into my add functions which would then go into my dijkstra algorithm computing the shortest path to a certain location. 
Lastly it will print out the shortest path as well as the total distance travelled
